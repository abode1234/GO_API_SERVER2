## Overview

This API provides a platform to manage a collection of books, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on book resources.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Go (Programming Language)
- MySQL (Database)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apiapp.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```
cd apiapp
```

3. Install the necessary Go packages:
```
go get .
```

4. Make sure MySQL is running and the database and user are correctly set up.

5. Start the server:
```
go run main.go
```

The server should start on `localhost:8080`, and you should see a message indicating that it's listening for requests.
